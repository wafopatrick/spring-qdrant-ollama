# Qdrant/Milvus + Ollama Search Application

This Spring Boot application demonstrates semantic search using Qdrant or Milvus as a vector database and AI-powered responses using Ollama with the Llama 3.1 model.

## Features

- **Vector Search**: Uses Qdrant or Milvus for semantic similarity search
- **AI Integration**: Leverages Ollama with Llama 3.1 for intelligent responses
- **Mock Data**: Includes 15 diverse documents across Technology, Science, Business, Health, and Education
- **REST API**: Simple HTTP endpoints for search functionality

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Java 24+
- Ollama with Llama 3.1 model installed

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Start Qdrant/Milvus

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start Qdrant on port 6333 and Milvus on port 19530.

### 2. Install and Start Ollama

First, install Ollama from [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)

Then pull the Llama 3.1 model:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
```

Start Ollama:

```bash
ollama serve
```

### 3. Run the Application

To switch between Qdrant and Milvus, you need to update the `application.properties` file located in `src/main/resources`.

- **For Qdrant**:

  ```properties
  vector-store.provider=qdrant
  ```

- **For Milvus**:

  ```properties
  vector-store.provider=milvus
  ```

Then run the application:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

The application will start on port 8080 and automatically initialize mock data in the selected vector store.

## Architecture

1. **Qdrant/Milvus Vector Store**: Stores document embeddings for semantic search
2. **Ollama Integration**: Provides AI-powered responses using Llama 3.1
3. **Spring AI**: Handles vector operations and AI model interactions
4. **REST API**: Exposes search functionality via HTTP endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Qdrant Connection Issues
- Ensure Docker is running
- Check if Qdrant is accessible at `http://localhost:6333`
- Verify the collection is created: `curl http://localhost:6333/collections/documents`

### Milvus Connection Issues
- Ensure Docker is running
- Check if Milvus is accessible at `http://localhost:19530`

### Ollama Issues
- Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Verify Llama 3.1 is installed: `ollama list`
- Check Ollama is accessible at `http://localhost:11434`

### Application Issues
- Check logs for detailed error messages
- Verify all services are running before starting the application
- Use the health endpoint to verify service status

## Development

To modify the mock data, edit the `generateMockDocuments()` method in `MockDataService.java`.

To change the AI model, update the `spring.ai.ollama.chat.model` property in `application.properties`.
